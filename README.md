Spring Boot with JWT Example
Spring Boot with JWT-

JWT- JSON Web Token- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

What is the JSON Web Token structure?
In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the content of the header should look like the following:
Authorization: Bearer <token>
